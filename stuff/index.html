          today i discovered something pretty amazing. github offers users one free hosting account, this account can be used
          to host personal websites etc... i used to use dropbox however github is second to none. pages load much quicker, you get
          the usual git functionality for revisions and so on and it's so easy to use!
          <br/><br/>
          you can also set extensionless pages with a couple of tricks to make your website look even more professional! highly recommended
          to anyone who always wanted a personal webpage but didn't want to go through all the usual setup hassles.

          i've been using mostly matlab for rapid prototyping for a while now. its great, loads of support and third party modules. however it sometimes feels a bit slow for large data sets, and does'nt give you that full programming satisfaction.
          <br/><br/>
          i switched to python in order to carry out data migration/ preparation for the GREAT03 challenge and i have fallen in love with the language. it is extreamly elengant, clean and also has loads of supporting libraries. i use pycharms ide, which is brilliant and also offers full git support.
