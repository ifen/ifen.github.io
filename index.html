            <h1>Dr Ian Fenech Conti</h1>
            <p>
              Dr Ian Fenech Conti completed his undergraduate studies in
              Information Technology—focusing on Computer Science and Artificial
              Intelligence—at the University of Malta. Soon after, he was
              invited to continue his work at the Department of Physics at the
              University of Oxford.
            </p>
            <p>
              He pursued a Ph.D in Physics through a collaboration between the
              University of Malta and the University of Oxford, focusing on
              optical modeling and simulation. His research centered on
              developing cutting-edge image processing and correction algorithms
              for space telescopes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following his Ph.D, he joined the Institute of Space Sciences and
              Astronomy (ISSA) at the University of Malta as an Affiliate
              Lecturer—continuing to evolve his work, especially for the
              European Space Agency’s Euclid Space Telescope. Currently, he
              serves as Head of Research & Product Development at Loqus Business
              Intelligence.

          <h1>Research</h1>
          <p>
            My primary research area focuses on applying Computer Science and AI
            techniques to Astrophysics, specifically in the field of weak
            gravitational lensing.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, I contributed to the
            <a href="https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/" target="_blank"
              >Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS)</a
            >
            project, where I was part of a team that developed a novel
            weak-lensing shear measurement pipeline that uses a self-calibration
            technique to correct for noise and weight biases—reducing shear
            biases to below 1%.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also worked on the
            <a

            mission, designing an innovative algorithm to model and measure the
            telescope's point spread function (PSF). This allows for precise
            correction of PSF effects in weak-lensing analyses, thereby
            improving our understanding of dark matter and dark energy.

          <h1>Logistics</h1>
          <p>
            I now work in the logistics industry, specifically on the software
            side, where I lead the R&D team behind a powerful optimisation
            platform for large-scale operations. Our product provides
            cutting-edge tools that help major companies plan, schedule, and
            deliver their routes and workloads efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            We focus on advanced technologies and intelligent algorithms that
            can handle operations involving up to a millions of daily
            transactions, all while respecting complex business constraints. Our
            goal is to ensure that every job and route is fulfilled in the most
            optimised way possible—balancing performance, scalability, and
            real-world practicality.
