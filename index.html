            <h1>Dr Ian Fenech Conti</h1>
            <p>
              Dr Ian Fenech Conti completed his undergraduate studies in
              Information Technology—focusing on Computer Science and Artificial
              Intelligence—at the
              <a

                >University of Malta</a
              >. Soon after, he was invited to continue his work at the
              Department of Physics at the University of Oxford.
            </p>
            <p>
              He pursued a Ph.D in Computer Science & Physics through a
              collaboration between the University of Malta and the University
              of Oxford, focusing on optical modeling and simulation. His
              research centered on developing cutting-edge image processing and
              correction algorithms for space telescopes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following his PhD, he joined the Institute of Space Sciences and
              Astronomy (ISSA) at the University of Malta as an Affiliate
              Lecturer—continuing to evolve his work and expand into new
              research areas, particularly in Artificial Intelligence and
              transform methods applied to radio astronomy. He also contributes
              to academic life by co-supervising MSc and PhD students, and
              occasionally delivering guest lectures on specialised topics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr Fenech Conti has since transitioned into industry while
              maintaining an academic post. He now serves as Director and Head
              of Research & Product Development at Loqus Business Intelligence

              for route planning and optimisation. His work focuses on
              delivering high-performance, scalable tools for major delivery and
              retail companies, tackling the complex challenges of logistics
              operations at scale.

          <h1>Research</h1>
          <p>
            My primary research area focuses on applying Computer Science and AI
            techniques to Astrophysics, specifically in the field of weak
            gravitational lensing.

              >Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS)</a
            >
            project, where I was part of a team that developed a novel
            weak-lensing shear measurement pipeline that uses a self-calibration
            technique to correct for noise and weight biases—reducing shear
            biases to below 1%.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also worked on the

            mission, designing an innovative algorithm to model and measure the
            telescope's point spread function (PSF). This allows for precise
            correction of PSF effects in weak-lensing analyses, thereby
            improving our understanding of dark matter and dark energy.

          <p>
            I now work in the logistics industry, specifically on the software
            side, where I lead the R&D team behind a powerful optimisation
            platform for large-scale operations. Our product provides
            cutting-edge tools that help major companies plan, schedule, and
            deliver their routes and workloads efficiently.

            We focus on advanced technologies and intelligent algorithms that
            can handle operations involving millions of daily transactions,
            ensuring that every job and route is fulfilled in the most optimised
            way possible—balancing performance, scalability, and real-world
            practicality.
