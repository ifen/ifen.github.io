            <p>
              Dr Ian Fenech Conti completed his undergraduate studies in
              Information Technology — specialising in Computer Science and
              Artificial Intelligence — at the University of Malta. He was
              subsequently invited to continue his work at the Department of
              Physics at the University of Oxford.
            </p>
            <p>
              He pursued a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Physics through a joint
              collaboration between the University of Malta and the University
              of Oxford, with a research focus on optical modelling and
              simulation. His work involved the development of cutting-edge
              image processing and correction algorithms for space telescopes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following his doctoral studies, he joined the Institute of Space
              Sciences and Astronomy (ISSA) at the University of Malta as an

              areas, including Artificial Intelligence and vision transformer
              models applied to radio astronomy. He also contributes to academic
              life through co-supervision of MSc and Ph.D. students and by
              delivering occasional guest lectures on specialised topics.

          <h1>Logistics</h1>
          <p>
            I currently work in the logistics industry, focusing on the software
            domain, where I lead the research and development team behind a
            sophisticated optimisation platform designed for large-scale
            operations. Our product empowers major enterprises to plan,
            schedule, and execute their routes and workloads with high
            efficiency, leveraging state-of-the-art optimisation tools tailored
            to real-world constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the core of our platform are advanced technologies and
            intelligent algorithms capable of managing millions of daily
            transactions. These systems ensure that jobs and routes are
            fulfilled in the most efficient and practical manner—striking a
            balance between performance, scalability, and operational
            reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to overseeing technical development, I play a key role
            in shaping the high-level strategy of the product—both from a
            technical and a business perspective. I work closely with
            stakeholders to define and evolve the product roadmap, ensuring that
            we continuously innovate, introduce valuable new features, and
            enhance existing functionality in response to user needs and
            industry trends.
